#### How to Use the Payloads

1. **Set Up Burp Suite Intruder:**
   - Open Burp Suite and navigate to the **Intruder** tab.
   - Send your request to Intruder by right-clicking on it in the Proxy tab and selecting **Send to Intruder**.
   - Configure the Intruder positions by selecting the directory or path you want to bypass.

2. **Load the Payloads:**
   - Copy the payloads from the provided wordlist.
   - Paste the payloads into the **Payload Options** input field in the Intruder tab.

3. **Payload Processing:**
   - Below the Payload Options section, locate the **Payload Processing** tool.
   - Click the **Add** button to open a new window.
   - Select the rule **Replace String**.
   - Replace the placeholder `{base}` with the base value you want to use for bypassing.

4. **Disable URL Encoding:**
   - Uncheck the option **URL-encode these characters** to ensure the payloads are not altered.

5. **Start the Attack:**
   - Click **Start Attack** and observe the results.
   - Look for requests that return a **200 status code**, indicating a successful bypass.

## Random Bug Bounty Tips and Tricks

### General Tips:
- **Automation is Key:** Use tools like Burp Suite, Nmap, and custom scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
- **Understand the Application:** Spend time understanding how the target application works to uncover hidden vulnerabilities.
- **Think Outside the Box:** Be creative and try unconventional methods to find flaws.

### Specific Tricks:
- **Header Injection:** Test for bypasses by adding headers like `X-Original-URL`, `X-Rewrite-URL`, or `X-Forwarded-For`.
- **Method Tampering:** Try HTTP methods like `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, or `PUT` to bypass restrictions.
